## Description
Nonflowers is a piece of software that procedurally generate drawings of nonexistent flowers. It attempts to capture the fascinating structures of plants and the delicate brushstrokes in [Gongbi paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongbi) with mathematical functions and procedural noises. Through parameterization and randomization, the algorithm is capable of generating a large variety of original plants. It is written in Javascript and uses HTML canvas to render its output. All the graphics are computed with polygons or using pixel-level manipulations, thus no preexisting asset or external library is used.
